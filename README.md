To perform this i have used the computer peripherals company sales data which is in the form of sql file that is database.sql it has the sales details of the company. 

First i have imported the file in to my sql workbench and by performing some sql operations i found some duplicates and i have also found some currency instances which were different from the other. I have decided to remove them in the power bi using transform data option where i can perform data cleaning using ETL.

This database has all sales transactions, customers, products, and market information. I have analysed the database and then imported it to power BI.

In power BI i performed ETL and data cleaning operations to make it ready so that i can build my dashboard.

In my dashboard
